 To begin with, it is beneficial to know the shape of the tables and whether any column has null values.
 Further in this segment, you will take a look at 'movies' and 'genre' tables.*/



-- Segment 1:




-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS movie_row_count FROM movie;
    
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ratings_row_count FROM ratings;
    
SELECT COUNT(*) AS genre_row_count FROM genre;
    
SELECT COUNT(*) AS directors_row_count FROM director_mapping;
    
SELECT COUNT(*) AS roles_row_count FROM role_mapping;
    
SELECT COUNT(*) AS names_row_count FROM names;


-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS title_nulls FROM movie WHERE title IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS year_nulls FROM movie WHERE year IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS date_published_nulls FROM movie WHERE date_published IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS duration_nulls FROM movie WHERE duration IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS country_nulls FROM movie WHERE country IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS worlwide_gross_income_nulls FROM movie WHERE worlwide_gross_income IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS languages_nulls FROM movie WHERE languages IS NULL;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS production_company_nulls FROM movie WHERE production_company IS NULL;


-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year. 
-- Q3. Find the total number of movies released each year? How does the trend look month wise? (Output expected)

-- Q4. How many movies were produced in the USA or India in the year 2019??

/* USA and India produced more than a thousand movies(you know the exact number!) in the year 2019.
Exploring table Genre would be fun!! 
Let’s find out the different genres in the dataset.*/

-- Q5. Find the unique list of the genres present in the data set?
-- Type your code below:


SELECT DISTINCT genre 
FROM genre;


/* So, RSVP Movies plans to make a movie of one of these genres.
Now, wouldn’t you want to know which genre had the highest number of movies produced in the last year?
Combining both the movie and genres table can give more interesting insights. */

-- Q6.Which genre had the highest number of movies produced overall?
-- Type your code below:

SELECT genre,COUNT(movie_id) as movie_count

/* So, based on the insight that you just drew, RSVP Movies should focus on the ‘Drama’ genre.
